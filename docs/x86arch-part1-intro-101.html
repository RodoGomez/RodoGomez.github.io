Welcome to this new series of posts, this time we'll be talking <font color=#93ffd7>about x86-64 computer 
architecture</font>, specifically, on the firsts posts, I'll give a very very basic 
introduction to computer architecture, how it works, CPU, memory and more, then in 
future posts we'll discuss the hardware support that Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures 
give to Operating Systems to achieve:

    * Memory Management.
    * Memory Addressing.
    * Memory Protection.
    * Separation and protection between Kernel-space and User-space.
    * Interrupts.
    * Hardware I/O.

Besides talking about hardware specific support, we'll explore <font color=#93ffd7>how the Linux 
Kernel uses those hardware features</font> from x86 processors through kernel debugging, 
analyzing kernel source code and implementing kernel modules that extract 
information to be analized.

By the moment of writing this post, I'm not sure about how many parts will compose 
this series, so this post will be the first out of n posts within this new series.

This first post will be about an introduction to computer architecture, we'll 
discuss the components that a computer system has and how they interact between each 
other (just a general, but complete, description). 

Notice that the content in this post will be just an introduction to all those 
concepts, even when I would try to give you a complete and general overview of the 
architecture of a computer system and how it works, I'm not pretending to touch 
every tiny detail about the subject.

Any way, if you want to go deeper on the concepts discussed in this post, I'll leave 
some useful references and links in the References section.

So, without further ado, let's get started.!



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Computer Architecture 101.</font></h3>
A computer system consists of different components and subsystems that work together 
creating a system able to compute instructions that solve specific tasks. 
In order to build this kind of system, there are different ways in which you can design 
it, define its components, its organization and ultimately how everything works within 
such system. That computer's design is called the <font color=#93ffd7>Computer Architecture.</font>

One of the most well known and implemented computer architecture in today's computer 
systems is the [Von Neumann Architecture.]

There are other computer architectures that are well known and actually implemented by 
different processors and real applications, such as the [Hardvard Architecture]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture). Von Neumann Architecture and 
Hardvard Architecture have many things in common, but they differ in how some componets 
interact between each other, how they store and retrieve information depending on the 
type of information (machine instructions against data) and so on. Any way, since Intel 
processors implement Von Neumann Architecture, the concepts and theory about computer 
architecture discussed in this series will relate to Von Neumann Architecture.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>System Organization.</font></h3>
Simplifying things, computer systems based on Von Neumann Architecture consist mainly 
in 3 well defined components:

    * CPU.
    * Memory (RAM).
    * I/O Devices.

And then, the CPU have another set of components within it:

    * Control Unit (CU).
    * Aritmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
    * Registers.



                    <img src="assets/computer-arch-series/von-neumman-arch.png" alt="Von Neumann Machine" width="450" height="400" align=center>




There are some processors that implement other hardware features such as caches, or 
even more than one processor within a single chip. 



<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Basic system functionality.</font></h4>
One of the most important features that Von Neumann brought with this architecture is 
that <font color=#93ffd7>CPU instructions and data from processes are stored in memory</font> when they are 
loaded to be executed, then, when a process is executing, <font color=#93ffd7>the CPU retreives CPU 
instructions and data as needed</font>. This was not the case in the early's days of 
computing, when only data could be stored in memory and hardware circuitry had to be 
modified for each program to be properly executed. Because of this, Von Neumann 
Architecture systems are also referred as stored-program computers.

All computations occur inside the CPU, as mentioned before, it retrieves information 
(CPU instructions and/or data) from memory and stores information in memory as needed 
as well. The CPU instructions are retreived and executed one by one, data is stored 
or retreived as needed, and when the execution of the current instruction is finished, 
then the CPU fetches the next one and repeats the cycle (this is the normal workflow 
of execution if we don't consider interrupts, I'll cover software and hardware 
interrupts in a future post).

It might be the case that the current executing process requires access to a hardware 
device that is connected to the CPU, in that case, the CPU communicates with I/O 
devices either sending or fetching information to/from them.

In this type of computer architecture, to the CPU, <font color=#93ffd7>dealing with most I/O devices 
is practically the same as dealing with memory</font>. To the CPU, I/O devices and memory 
are just external components to which it can interact with by sending or fetching 
data to/from them. Any way, there are differences in the way CPUs exchange information 
between memory and I/O devices, and of course, we'll talk about it :D.



                    <img src="assets/computer-arch-series/system-bus-book.png" alt="System Bus" width="500" height="333" align=center>

          <font color=#93ffd7>Image from Art of Intel x86 Assembly book (see References section)</font>



All this components, I/O devices, memory and the CPU, need a way to exchange 
information between them and the way in which that comunication is implemented is 
called the <font color=#93ffd7>System Bus</font>.




<h3><font color=#93ffd7>The System Bus.</font></h3>
In simple terms, <font color=#93ffd7>the System Bus is just a set of electrical conexions that exists in 
the physical circuit</font> (mother board of the computer) and this bus interconnects all 
the components in the computer system. The System Bus is literally a <font color=#93ffd7>set of wires 
that transport electrical signals</font> between computer components. 

The specific implementation of the System Bus depends totally on the characteristics 
of the processor that's being used but the function of the bus is always the same, 
to transport electrical signals between components allowing communication between them.

A typical x86 processor uses standard TTL logic levels as voltage for the transmitted 
signals. A standard TTL logic level zero is represented by a voltage in the range 
0.0 - 0.8v, whereas a logic one is represented by a voltage level in the range 
2.4 - 5v.

The System Bus can be divided in 3 different busses:

    * Data Bus.
    * Address Bus.
    * Control Bus.



                        <img src="assets/computer-arch-series/system-bus.png" alt="System Bus" width="450" height="333" align=center>



These busses have their own porpuse, but remember, all of them have the same essential 
function, transport electrical signals between components, the meaning of this signals 
and what information do the busses carry is what defines the specific function of each 
bus in the system.



<h4><font color=#93ffd7>The Data Bus.</font></h4>
As it's name suggests, <font color=#93ffd7>the Data Bus is used to shuffle data between the computer 
system components</font>. Historically, the size (I mean, how many wires the bus has) has 
changed between different processors, having size values of:

    * 8 bits.
    * 16 bits.
    * 32 bits.
    * 64 bits.

As you might expect, the newer the processor the bigger the data bus size. 

Even though all busses have different sizes between processors (data bus, control bus 
and address bus), <font color=#93ffd7>the Data Bus size has more impact on the performance of the system 
than the other ones</font>. Practically, a system with a 16 bit data bus is twice as fast 
as a system with an 8 bit data bus. And sure, having a 32 bit data bus means that the 
circuit has 32 physical wires, each wire is equivalent to a bit.

That way, the CPU is capable of moving data to/from memory in chunks of the same size 
of the data bus per memory cycle (by memory cycle, I mean the entire event of 
storing or fetching data and it's totally different than CPU cycles, so don't confuse 
them). In a system with an 8 bit data bus, it takes one memory cycle to fetch 8 bits 
of data, twice for 16 bits and so on.

It's important to notice that the size of the data bus <font color=#93ffd7>does not limit the size of 
data types that a process (program) can use</font>. You can have 32 bit data types in a 
program that is running on a system with a data bus of 16 bits, this only means that 
it will take two memory cycles to fetch the entire 32 bit data.

<font color=#93ffd7>Have you heard someone saying "I have a 32-bit system" or "my laptop is a 64-bit 
computer"?</font> Well, it turns out that <font color=#93ffd7>the size of the Data Bus determines what's 
called the size of the processor</font>. That way, a system with an 8 bit data bus is 
called an 8 bit processor, same way, a 32 bit processor has a 32 bit data bus.

Notice that the data bus is not only used to move data between the CPU and memory, 
<font color=#93ffd7>it is used as well for moving data between I/O devices and the CPU</font>. In fact, some 
I/O devices can appear another section in the accesible memory (remember that to the 
CPU, most I/O devices are kind of the same as memory).

The CPU needs a way to specify from where in memory or from where in an I/O device it 
wants to fecth data (or store data). The solution to this is provided by the address 
bus.



<h4><font color=#93ffd7>The Address Bus.</font></h4>
The CPU uses the address bus to specify the <font color=#93ffd7>location (memory address) from where it 
wants to retrieve data (and again, to where store it) either from memory or from an 
I/O device</font>. So every time the CPU wants to access information in memory or in I/O 
devices, it just places the corresponding address in the Address Bus. 

Memory and I/O devices have internal circuitry as well, when the CPU requests 
information from a specific address, the circuitry from memory and I/O devices 
recognizes that they contain the address requested by the processor, if they have such 
address of course, and acts in response (storing or sending data). If they don't 
recongnize the address, they just ignore it.

The amount of wires that the Address Bus has <font color=#93ffd7>determines the amount of physical 
addressable memory</font>. That way, if you have an address bus with just one wire, you'd 
be able to address only two unique addresses, 0 and 1. 

Firsts x86 processors had an address bus of 20 bits (wires) which allows them to 
address up to 1,048,576 different locations, which is the same as 1 MegaByte of 
addressable memory.

Modern processors have a 32 bits address bus, which allows them to address up to 
4,294,976,296, or 4GB of addressable memory. There exist hardware mechanisms that allow 
an expansion of addressable memory increasing the address bus from a 32 bit address bus 
to a 36 bit address bus, allowing the processor to address up to 64GB of memory, but 
we'll discuss it in a future post :D. 

Notice that <font color=#93ffd7>memory and I/O devices share the same address bus!</font>

Something important is, <font color=#93ffd7>the maximum amount of addressable memory is always the same 
as the address bus size, but the address bus size for I/O devices is always 16 bits 
long</font>, what happens is that when accessing memory, all the address bus is used to 
specify the location in memory, but when accessing I/O devices, only the 16 least 
significat bits of the address bus are used. In consequence the processor is able to 
address up to 65,536 different I/O locations.

If the CPU sees memory and I/O as the same thing, how does the CPU specify that the 
resquested address belongs to a memory location and not to a I/O device and vice versa? 
How does the CPU communicates that it wants to store some data at a specific address 
instead of fetching data from that same address?
To solve this issues, the control bus comes into the picture!



<h4><font color=#93ffd7>The Control Bus.</font></h4>
This is probably the bus that has more differences between different processors, in 
simple terms, the control bus is used by the CPU to send specific signals to the rest 
of the components that determines how it wants to communicates. For example, <font color=#93ffd7>there are 
2 dedicated wires in the control bus used to specify if the CPU wants to read data 
from memory or if it wants to write data to memory</font>. 

As I said, there are different designs of the control bus, but regardless those 
differences, there are some signals that are common between processors.

There are signals in the control bus that are used to specify when the CPU wants to read 
or write data, as well as signals used to specify if the CPU wants to access memory or 
an I/O device. 

So when the CPU wants to read something from memory, it places the desired address in the 
address bus, and it places the respective values in the control bus specifying it wants to 
read instead of writing, and that it want such information from memory and not an I/O 
device, finally the circuitry from memory recognizes that the CPU is asking for some 
information from it at an specific location, if such address exists, memory places the 
data in the data bus and the CPU just reads it, and that's how (in a general description) 
communication between CPU and memory occurs.



                 <img src="assets/computer-arch-series/read-memory.png" alt="Read Memory" width="600" height="333" align=center>

                       <font color =#93ffd7>Images form Art of Intel x86 Assembly book</font>



And in the other hand, the control bus places the respective signal on the control bus 
specifying it wants to write some data in memory.



                 <img src="assets/computer-arch-series/write-memory.png" alt="Write Memory" width="600" height="333" align=center>

                       <font color =#93ffd7>Images form Art of Intel x86 Assembly book</font>

When the CPU wants information from an I/O device, the process is mostly the same, with 
the only difference that the CPU places in the control bus a signal specifying that it 
wants such information from I/O instead of memory. In this scenario, circuitry in the 
I/O device recognize that the CPU requested information from it, and if it contains the 
requested address, it responds placing the information located at such address in the 
data bus. And remember, the address bus for I/O devices is always 16 bits, so the CPU 
places the requested address in the address bus, but using the least significant bits 
in the address bus and the remaining bits are just ignored.

NOTE: By the moment of writing this post I haven't found that much information about the 
exact configuration of the control bus signals on different processors, because of that 
I'm not able to specify the name of the signals, the values and interpretation they have 
on real processors D:, any way as soon as I get more information I'll update this post :D.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Let's talk about memory.</h3></font>
Just before the end of this post, let's talk about memory.
x86 processors supports <font color=#93ffd7>byte addressable memory</font>, which this means is that the 
smallest and more basic unit of memory that x86 processors are able to access is a single 
byte (a byte is equal to 8 bits).

You can imagine memory as an array of cells, <font color=#93ffd7>each cell can store 1 byte, or in other 
words, each cell is composed of 8 bits</font>, and the exact location of each cell within the 
array is what is known as the memory address. 



                <img src="assets/computer-arch-series/memory-ram.png" alt="Read Memory" width="600" height="240" align=center>



Memory addresses will be always given in hexadecimal numbers, so it's really important 
that you understand numerical systems and conversions.

When dealing with memory values and addresses, you will notice that some places uses the 
terms word, byte, double word and so on, so let's explain it.

<font color=#93ffd7>The most basic unit of memory (I'm talking about unit of memory itself, not unit of 
addressable memory by the CPU) is a bit</font>, with it you can represent 2 values, 0 or 1, 
and those two values could mean whatever you want them to mean, black and white, on or 
off, up or down, or even 7541 and 500. 

Then, there are the nibbles, <font color=#93ffd7>a nibble is a collection of 4 bits</font> and the bit that 
is at the most right side is called the least significant bit (LSB) in contrast with 
the most left side bit, which is called the most significant bit (MSB).

Then we have a byte, <font color=#93ffd7>a byte is composed of 8 bits, or 2 nibbles</font>, the nibble that 
is at the right is called the Low Order nibble and the other one is called the High 
Order nibble, this because the LO nibble contains the LSB and the HO nibble contains 
the MSB.

Then we have a word, <font color=#93ffd7>a word consists of 16 bits, or 2 bytes, or 4 nibbles</font>.
It also has its LO nibble and HO nibble plus its HO byte and its LO byte.

Then there is the double word, <font color=#93ffd7>a double word contains 32 bits, or 4 bytes, or 8 
nibbles</font>, and it has its LO and HO nibbles, bytes and words.



                <img src="assets/computer-arch-series/memory-units.jpg" alt="Read Memory" width="600" height="240" align=center>



This terms apply when you are talking about memory values, sizes of data types and other 
cases, for instance, when reading assembly, you might see an instrucction saying 
something like:

    MOV eax, DWORD PTR [ebx]

That dword is telling that this assembly instrucction requires to access a value in 
memory that is a double word value, or a 4 bytes value.

Well, this is already a huge post, it might be kind of boring to learn this things, I 
tried to be as brief as possible but complete and concrete at the same time.

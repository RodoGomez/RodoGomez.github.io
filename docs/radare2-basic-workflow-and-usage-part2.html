This is the second post out of two that describes the usage of Radare2 to perform basic 
tasks that relate to binary analysis. In the <a href=https://rodogomez.github.io/radare2-basic-workflow-and-usage>previous post</u></a> a brief introduction to r2
was given, as well as a basic workflow working on command mode within r2. 

In this post, we'll explore how to perform a basic analysis, operations and exploration 
of a binary working on <font color=#93ffd7>Visual Mode</font> within r2.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Let's recap: r2 modes of operation.</font></h3>
As mentioned in the previous post, Radare2 has two modes of operation:

    * Command Mode.
    * Visual Mode.

Command mode is the default mode, here, <font color=#93ffd7>all r2 commands are available</font>.

Visual mode provides a set of different commands and this mode outputs the information 
in a graphical way, same that is actually an interactive interface.

One of the most important things you have to remember is that there are commands that 
perform the same action in both modes, but there are commands that, even when they 
look the same, perform a total different thing between modes.

Finally, remember that, when in doubt, you can always use the <font color=#93ffd7>-? command-</font>.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Before we jump into it:</font></h3>
For this series of posts, we are going to use the following simple C program:

┌
│
│    int sum(int x, int y){
│        return x + y;
│    }
│
│    int mul(int x, int y){
│        return x * y;
│    }
│     
│    int main(){ 
│        int a = 10, b = 5, c = 0, d = 0;
│        c = sum(a ,b);
│        d = mul(a, b);
│
│        if(c < d)
│            return c;
│        else
│            return d;
│     
│        return 0xdefea7;
│    }
│
└

<font color=#93ffd7>NOTE:</font> In this series of posts we will be working with x86 binaries under the Linux OS so,
the code above was compiled with the following command:


┌                                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>$</font> gcc -m32 -o post-sample post-sample.c   │
└                                             ┘


Where <font color=#93ffd7>-m32</font> is the compilation flag used to specify that we want gcc to compile our code 
for <font color=#93ffd7>x86 architecture (32 bits)</font>.

So we have now an x86 binary ready to be analyzed with r2.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Opening a binary with Radare2</font></h3>
Let's begin by opening our binary and run r2 analysis at once:


┌                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>$</font> r2 -A ./post-sample     │
└                             ┘


Remember that the fuse -A makes r2 to run an analysis of the binary, creating flags and 
gathering useful information about the binary.

We should get the following result:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/ss1.png" alt="post-sample" width="950" height="560" align=center>



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Working in Visual Mode.</font></h3>
Visual mode provides, as its name suggests, <font color=#93ffd7>a more graphical way of displaying information</font>.
In some way, visual mode provides a more user-friendly interface to work with when 
analyzing binaries.

Something important you have to remember is that in visual mode not all the r2 commands 
are available, and there are commands that do a different thing in visual mode compared 
with command mode.

This mode does not provide only one interface to the user, instead, visual mode consists 
of a set of <font color=#93ffd7>print modes</font>, also referred as <font color=#93ffd7>panels</font>.

Something that is a little bit confusing at the beginning, and that is important that 
you understand, is that such print modes <font color=#93ffd7>share some commands</font> (those commands do the same 
regardless the print mode), but there are other commands that <font color=#93ffd7>does not do the same 
action</font> and even, there are commands that are present in some print modes but aren't in 
others.

You can think of it as if each print mode was actually a kind of <font color=#93ffd7>sub-mode</font> within 
visual mode.

The different print modes available in visual mode are:

<font color=#93ffd7>↻</font> Hexdump panel → Disassembly panel → Debugger panel → Hexadecimal words dump panel → 
Hex-less hexdump panel → Op analysis color map panel → Annotated hexdump panel <font color=#93ffd7>↻</font>

The arrows represent <font color=#93ffd7>the order of switching</font> between print modes.

There is a special print mode, full of different functionalities and options, and it's 
almost like if it was actually a third mode in r2, called <font color=#93ffd7>Panels view</font>, (which is 
the print mode that I personally use the most) but officially it is another print mode 
within visual mode, we'll explore this special print mode last.

You can switch between print modes, but before explaining that, let's switch to Visual 
mode first.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Switching to visual mode.</font></h3>
At this point, we are currently in command mode. In order to change to visual mode we 
can use the <font color=#93ffd7>-V command-</font> (note the uppercase):


┌                       ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>[</font>0<font color=#93ffd7>x</font>08049050<font color=#93ffd7>]</font>> V     │
└                       ┘



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img1-Visual-mode-hex-dump.png" alt="Disassembly panel" width="950" height="560" align=center>



Now we are in visual mode. The default print mode that you see once you enter in visual 
mode is an hex dump view of the current seek. 

You can switch to other print modes using either the <font color=#93ffd7>-p command-</font> or <font color=#93ffd7>-P 
command-</font>:

<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Disassembly panel:</font></h4>
<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img2-Visual-mode-disassembly-view.png" alt="Disassembly panel" width="950" height="560" align=center>



<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Color map panel:</font></h4>
<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img3-color-map-panel.png" alt="Color map panel" width="950" height="560" align=center>


By now, let's explore our workflow within the disassembly panel.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Exploring the binary.</font></h3>
At this point, our current seek is the very beginning of our binary code, we can move 
around and explore the disassembled code using the <font color=#93ffd7>arrow keys or h, j, k, and l keys</font>, 
same as the ones you use in the Vim text editor.

Moving using such keys allows you to navigate the disassembled code but only one line 
at a time. 

You can go directly to specific locations, like a specific function or a specific part 
of the binary if you know its location within the binary, by using the flag of such 
function or binary location using the <font color=#93ffd7>_ command</font>. 

Let's supose you want to go to the main function, just type <font color=#93ffd7>_</font> and a list of r2 flags 
will be displayed:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img5-using_command-main.png" alt="_ command" width="950" height="560" align=center>



Then just type <font color=#93ffd7>main</font> and press <font color=#93ffd7>ENTER</font>.

Now our current seek is the location of main:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img6-using_command-main2.png" alt="_ command main" width="950" height="560" align=center>



This way, the _ command is useful to <font color=#93ffd7>search for specific functions/locations</font> within our 
binary.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>The view management.</font></h3>
View management is a functionality that <font color=#93ffd7>is only available if you are NOT in Panels 
view</font> (but it's available in all the other print modes).

The view management provides a set of options and functionalities that can be applied 
to the functions of our binary. 

This functionality is accessed using the<font color=#93ffd7> -v command-</font>:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img7-View-management.png" alt="View management." width="950" height="560" align=center>



As you can see, a list of all the functions of our binary is displayed and a preview 
of the disassembled code of the selected function is showed as well.

Using the <font color=#93ffd7>up</font> and <font color=#93ffd7>down arrow keys</font>, or <font color=#93ffd7>j</font> and <font color=#93ffd7>k</font> you can move between functions (see how 
an <font color=#93ffd7>*</font> symbol works as a cursor when moving around between functions in the list).
 
Using the <font color=#93ffd7>right arrow key</font>, or <font color=#93ffd7>l key</font>, specific options (that applies to the current 
selected function) are displayed that relates to actions like add, rename, type and 
so on.

For a simple binary analysis, the options that I found useful the most are:

    * Rename a function.
    * The <font color=#93ffd7>calls</font> option.

In order to ilustrate this functionalities, let's rename our functions <font color=#93ffd7>sum</font> and <font color=#93ffd7>mul</font>. 
Remember that r2 found them when it ran the analysis and assigned them a flag. That 
way our functions are referenced by the flags <font color=#93ffd7>sym.sum</font> and<font color=#93ffd7> sym.mul</font>.

If we want to rename <font color=#93ffd7>sym.sum</font> function, we move the cursor selecting it, and press 
<font color=#93ffd7>r</font>, after that we'll be asked to write the new name:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img8-View-management-renaming-a-function.png" alt="View management renaming." width="950" height="560" align=center>



Let's rename it as <font color=#93ffd7>sum</font> and then press<font color=#93ffd7> ENTER</font>.



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img9-Renaming-a-function-new-name.png" alt="View management renaming2." width="950" height="560" align=center>



And the same applies to <font color=#93ffd7>sym.mul</font>:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img10-Renaming-a-function-new-name2.png" alt="View management renaming3." width="950" height="560" align=center>



In the other hand, the <font color=#93ffd7>calls</font> option provides very useful information about the 
selected function, you can use this function just by typing <font color=#93ffd7>c</font>:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img11-calls-functionality.png" alt="View management calls." width="950" height="560" align=center>



Some of the most useful information is:

* <font color=#93ffd7>Call-convention</font>: Tells us the <font color=#93ffd7>calling convection</font> that the code is using, this is 
important when reversing a binary.

* <font color=#93ffd7>locals</font>: Tells us how many <font color=#93ffd7>local variables are</font> in the function (NOTE: the number of 
local variables may be different than the ones that were used in the source code, this 
is because the generated assembly code from the compiler may create more or less local 
variables depending on factors like optimizations at compile time.)

* <font color=#93ffd7>args</font>: Tells us how many arguments there are in the function signature.

Once you are done with the view management, you can exit from there by pressing 
<font color=#93ffd7>q</font>.


<h4><font color=#93ffd7>r2 commands within visual mode.</font></h4>
As said before, when you are in visual mode, not all the r2 commands are available, 
at least not directly. But such limitation is not that real. There is a way to 
<font color=#93ffd7>execute all the commands that are available in command mode being in visual mode</font>.

When in visual mode, <font color=#93ffd7>in any of the print modes</font>, you can get an "r2 terminal" to 
execute command mode commands by pressing <font color=#93ffd7>:</font> (semicolon)



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img12-r2-commands-from-visual-mode.png" alt="r2 commands from visual mode." width="950" height="560" align=center>



As you can see, <font color=#93ffd7>a promt</font> is displayed. Here you can type and execute any of the commands
that are present in command mode.

This is really useful because, as long as you use Radare2, you'll notice that you need 
to hex dump an specific location in memory, or print the contents of some location 
stored in a register and so on.

When you start running commands in this promt, you may notice that the interface suffer
a <font color=#93ffd7>scrolling-up</font> and you lose your print mode, <font color=#93ffd7>don't worry.!</font>, once you are done with 
your r2 commands, just <font color=#93ffd7>press ENTER</font> (without any command on the promt) and the print 
mode is restored as it was before switching to the promt.

At this point, you should be able to navigate the disassembled code of any binary, 
rename functions, gather information, and explore more options in visual mode. But 
that's not the end of this post, let's now explore my favorite print mode, let's 
explore <font color=#93ffd7>Panels view</font>.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Panels view.</font></h3>
Panels view provides an interface with <font color=#93ffd7>splitted windows</font>, each window is called a <font color=#93ffd7>panel</font>,
and each of those panels can show different print modes or different r2 command's 
output at the same time.

That way, you can have a main panel that shows the disassembled code, another one to 
see the registers, another one to display the stack and so on.

There are basically 2 ways to switch to panels view, depending on your current r2 mode:


<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Switching from visual mode to panels view.</font></h4>
To switch to panels view when you are currently in any print mode, within visual mode 
of course, just use the <font color=#93ffd7>-! command-</font>.



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img13-panels-view-1.png" alt="panels view." width="950" height="560" align=center>



<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Switching from command mode to panels view.</font></h4>
To switch to panels view when you are currently in command mode, just use the <font color=#93ffd7>-v 
command-</font>(Note the lower case).



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img13-panels-view-1.png" alt="Panels view." width="950" height="560" align=center>



That way, if you are in command mode, using the <font color=#93ffd7>-v command-</font> you switch to <font color=#93ffd7>panels view</font>, 
whereas using the <font color=#93ffd7>-V command-</font> change to <font color=#93ffd7>visual mode</font>.


<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Working in panels view.</font></h4>
Panels view shares some functionalities with all the other print modes, but one that 
<font color=#93ffd7>is not present is view management</font>, that way if you need something from view 
management you'll need to switch to any other print mode.

If you need to execute r2 commands, you can do it the same way as in any other print 
mode, by using the <font color=#93ffd7>-: command-</font>.



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img14-r2-commands-panel-view.png" alt="r2 commands from panels view." width="950" height="560" align=center>



When I first ever launched this view, the default interface displayed 3 different 
panels, the bigger one showed the disassembled code, and the other ones showed an 
hex dum of the stack and the registers.

Being honest, at this point I'm not sure if those are the default panels, but don't 
worry, we'll explore how to customize them.

You can move between panels using the <font color=#93ffd7>TAB key</font>.

As you can see, there are some options at the top of the window, you can access 
such options using the <font color=#93ffd7>-m command-</font>. You can explore the options available 
moving with the <font color=#93ffd7>arrow keys</font> or <font color=#93ffd7>h, j, k and l</font>.



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img15-m-command-windows.png" alt="m command windows." width="950" height="560" align=center>



If you want to search and go to an specific function in the disassembled code, you 
can do it the same way as in other print mode, using the <font color=#93ffd7>-_ command-</font>.


<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Customizing the panels.</font></h4>
Let's customize the two smaller panels. One way to achieve this is by moving to the 
desired panel and press the <font color=#93ffd7>DEL key</font>:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img16-customize-panel-1.png" alt="Customizing panel1." width="950" height="560" align=center>



A menu is displayed with multiple predefined options, you can choose from them and 
just press ENTER to make the selection.

All this predefined views use an specific fixed r2 command, same that is visible 
at the top of each panel, but this is not the only way to customize the panels.

You can provide to any panel your <font color=#93ffd7>own custom r2 command</font> by using the <font color=#93ffd7>-e 
command-</font>, just move to the desired panel and use the command:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img17-customize-panel-2.png" alt="Customizing panel2." width="950" height="560" align=center>



At the top of the window, a promt will be displayed asking you to write your r2 
command, that way, whatever the output of that command is, it will <font color=#93ffd7>be displayed in 
the selected panel</font>.

I personally use those two panels to display the stack and the registers, respectively. 

The command I use to display the stack is:

┌                      ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>pxW</font> @esp           │
└                      ┘


<font color=#93ffd7>px</font> belongs to the <font color=#93ffd7>print hexadecimal</font> commands. <font color=#93ffd7>W</font> specifies the size of the hex 
dump and stands for <font color=#93ffd7>word</font> size. Notice that <font color=#93ffd7>in radare2 a word is 32 bits</font>. And <font color=#93ffd7>W</font> is 
uppercase, which specifies that the output will be displayed one word per line.

And for the registers I just use the predefined one, using the <font color=#93ffd7>DEL key</font>.



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img18-custom-panels.png" alt="Customizing panels." width="950" height="560" align=center>



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Bonus: Graph view.</font></h3>
Graph view displays the <font color=#93ffd7>disassembled code showing the branches (if any) and a call 
graph view as well</font>.

When in visual mode, <font color=#93ffd7>in any print mode</font>, you can go to graph view using the 
<font color=#93ffd7>SPACE key</font>.



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img19-Graph-view.png" alt="Graph view1." width="950" height="560" align=center>



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/img20-Graph-view2.png" alt="Graph view2." width="950" height="560" align=center>



The displayed disassembled code depends on the <font color=#93ffd7>current seek</font>, if you are located at 
main in the binary, then the disassembled code will be from main.

You can move around the graph view using the <font color=#93ffd7>arrow keys</font> and <font color=#93ffd7>h, j, k and l 
keys</font>.

This view helps you see in a more ilustrative interface the branches created by <font color=#93ffd7>if</font> 
statements, <font color=#93ffd7>switch cases</font> and other <font color=#93ffd7>conditional</font> and <font color=#93ffd7>non-conditional</font> jumps in 
code.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Getting help.</font></h3>
Regardless the current mode you are in, you can use the <font color=#93ffd7>-? command</font> to get help.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Conclusions.</font></h3>
Now you should be able to perform a <font color=#93ffd7>basic binary analysis using both command mode 
and visual mode</font>. From here, you can dedice which mode, or which print mode, is 
better for you. 

Notice that knowing how to use tools for binary analysis, such as Radare2, is just 
useful if you have previous knowledge about concepts like <font color=#93ffd7>assembly, computer 
architecture and even programming</font>. In future posts, I'll be exploring some stuff 
about those concepts that migth be helpful for everyone interested in this areas.

This is the first post out of two that describes the usage of Radare2 to perform basic 
tasks that relate to binary analysis. That way, instead of explaining what a bunch of 
Radare commands do, this post goes through a basic workflow from opening a binary file, 
gather basic information about it, dissasemble it, explaining and working with the 
different modes that Radare2 offers and explore the disassembled binary.

<font color=#93ffd7>NOTE:</font> Debugging a binary file deserves its own post so it will be covered in a 
future post.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Let's begin: What's Radare2?</font></h3>
Radare2, also known as <font color=#93ffd7>r2</font>, is the integration of a set of Unix-like, open source, 
tools to perform binary analysis from different standpoints of view. As any Unix-like 
application, r2 provides a <font color=#93ffd7>command-line inteface</font> to interact with. 

There exist GUIs such as <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter><u>Cutter</u></a>, which is powered by <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin><u>Rizin</u></a> (a fork of r2 focused
on usability). 

Because of its capabilities, r2 can be seen as:

    * A reverse engineering framework.
    * A forensics tool for binaries.
    * A debugging tool.
    * An exploit development framework.
    * and much more...

You can get r2 from its <a href=https://github.com/radareorg/radare2><u>Official GitHub repo.</u></a> Instructions about how to clone it, 
install it and set it up can be found there.

If you wish to read a more extended documentation about r2, you can go through its 
<a href=https://book.rada.re/><u>Official book</u></a> as well.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Before we jump into it:</font></h3>
For this series of posts, we are going to use the following simple C program:

┌
│
│    int sum(int x, int y){
│        return x + y;
│    }
│
│    int mul(int x, int y){
│        return x * y;
│    }
│     
│    int main(){ 
│        int a = 10, b = 5, c = 0, d = 0;
│        c = sum(a ,b);
│        d = mul(a, b);
│
│        if(c < d)
│            return c;
│        else
│            return d;
│     
│        return 0xdefea7;
│    }
│
└

<font color=#93ffd7>NOTE:</font> In this series of posts we will be working with x86 binaries under the Linux OS so,
the code above was compiled with the following command:


┌                                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>$</font> gcc -m32 -o post-sample post-sample.c   │
└                                             ┘


Where <font color=#93ffd7>-m32</font> is the compilation flag used to specify that we want gcc to compile our code 
for <font color=#93ffd7>x86 architecture (32 bits)</font>.

So we have now an x86 binary ready to be analyzed with r2.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Opening a binary with Radare2</font></h3>
As mentioned before, r2 is a set of Unix-like tools, so from this point everything is 
going to be achieved with <font color=#93ffd7>commands</font>.

The simpliest way to open a binary with r2 is by just providing to r2 command the name 
of our binary file without any other fuse (aka flag):


┌                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>$</font> radare2 file-name       │
└                             ┘


or


┌                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>$</font> r2 file-name            │
└                             ┘


By doing it this way, r2 is just going to open the binary file <font color=#93ffd7>without performing any 
sort of analysis to it</font> (more on this below). 

To see the different fuses that r2 accepts when launching it, you can use the command:


┌                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>$</font> r2 -h                   │
└                             ┘


The fuse that we are going to be using the most when working with r2 is -A, that way 
the command to open our file is:


┌                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>$</font> r2 -A ./post-sample     │
└                             ┘


When reading the help for the commands available, we see that for <font color=#93ffd7>the fuse -A</font> the help 
says that <font color=#93ffd7>"run aaa command to analyze all referenced code"</font>. This means that first 
it opens the binary with radare2 and then <font color=#93ffd7>it runs the r2 command aaa</font>.

One of the outputs from running <font color=#93ffd7>aaa command</font> is the creation of <font color=#93ffd7>flags</font> (as radare2 
call them). With aaa command, r2 goes through the provided binary and for everything 
that found interesting it creates a flag to reference it. 

For example, it creates flags for <font color=#93ffd7>functions, variables, sections and so on</font>. That's 
the way r2 makes a 'recognition' of the binary and its properties.

It also gathers useful information about the binary in question, such as <font color=#93ffd7>metadata 
associated with it, compilation information such as compilation flags used, compiler 
version, timestamps, binary size, sections, the system used for the creation of the 
binary, exploitation mitigations status, permissions and more</font>. 

Notice that you can get the same result by opening the file without the -A flag and 
then run the aaa command manually once you are in r2.

Once we open our file, we get the following result:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/ss1.png" alt="post-sample" width="950" height="560" align=center>



The output that is displayed is the result of the option -A.



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Radare2 modes of operation.</font></h3>
In general terms, we could say that Radare2 has <font color=#93ffd7>2 modes of operation</font>:

    * Command mode
    * Visual mode

<font color=#93ffd7>Command mode:</font> This is the default mode within r2. When in this mode, <font color=#93ffd7>all r2 commands 
are available</font>.

<font color=#93ffd7>Visual mode:</font> This mode provides a set of different capabilities in which you can see 
and interact with the binary and its information. As its name suggests, the 
information is outputed in a more <font color=#93ffd7>visual and graphical way</font>.

There are several differences of how each mode works, commands, options and so on, 
but the most important difference that you have to get in mind is that <font color=#93ffd7>the available 
commands between modes differ in the total number of them and what they do</font>. 
In command mode, all r2 commands are available whereas in visual mode, there are less 
commands available but, <font color=#93ffd7>there are commands that perform a different thing between 
modes</font>.

In other words, in visual mode you have a set of commands that are less than the 
ones available in command mode, <font color=#93ffd7>some commands do the same in both modes, but there 
are commands that in visual mode do a total different thing</font>.

Understanding that and having it in mind will save you several errors and time :D

We are going to start with command mode and then we'll move to visual mode (which is 
the mode that I actually use the most).



<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Working in command mode</font></h3>
Once we open our binary, <font color=#93ffd7>the default mode is the command mode</font>. You can see that an 
hex number appears in the r2 promt, that hex number (which varies between platforms 
such as Windows, Linux, etc) is our current location (address location) within the 
binary, also known as our current <font color=#93ffd7>seek</font>.


<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Displaying information</font></h4>
As our binary has been already analyzed, the <font color=#93ffd7>-i command-</font> displays a bunch of 
information collected during r2 analysis.


┌                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>[</font>0<font color=#93ffd7>x</font>08049050<font color=#93ffd7>]</font>> i           │
└                             ┘


You can clear the screen with the command, well, ***-clear-***:


┌                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>[</font>0<font color=#93ffd7>x</font>08049050<font color=#93ffd7>]</font>> clear       │
└                             ┘



<h4><font color=#93ffd7>List functions</font></h4>
One very useful command is the <font color=#93ffd7>-afl command-</font>. It's used to list all functions 
that r2 found in the binary: 



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/afl-command.png" alt="afl command" width="950" height="560" align=center>




You can see the functions of our program referenced as <font color=#93ffd7>sym.sum, sym.mul and main</font>. 
Those are the flags mentioned before, it's a kind of tag created by r2 and used to 
reference useful properties found in the binary.

This information wouldn't be available if we do not perform the analysis either by 
opening the file with the -A option or by running the aaa command in radare2.

Another nice way to list all the functions with a bit more of information presented 
like a table is by using the <font color=#93ffd7>-afll command-</font>.



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/afll-command.png" alt="afll command" width="950" height="560" align=center>




<h4><font color=#93ffd7>Printing the disassembled binary.</font></h4>
One of the main functionalities used in r2 is the disassembler. There are different 
ways to display the disassembled code in r2, the simpliest one is just using the 
<font color=#93ffd7>-pd command-</font>, which stands for <font color=#93ffd7>print disassembly</font>. 



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/pd-command.png" alt="pd command" width="950" height="560" align=center>




The<font color=#93ffd7>-pd command-</font> prints the disassembled code of the <font color=#93ffd7>current location</font>. You can 
see that it displays just a part of all the disassembly code, that is because of 
the <font color=#93ffd7>block size</font>.

The default value of the block size is <font color=#93ffd7>0x100</font> and can be set with the <font color=#93ffd7>-b command-</font>.


┌                             ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>[</font>0<font color=#93ffd7>x</font>08049050<font color=#93ffd7>]</font>> b new-size  │
└                             ┘


You can print the disassembly code of all the content of a function regardless if 
it fits or not in the block size. <font color=#93ffd7>To print a disassembled function</font> you can use the 
command:


┌                                     ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>[</font>0<font color=#93ffd7>x</font>08049050<font color=#93ffd7>]</font>> pdf @function-flag  │
└                                     ┘


Where <font color=#93ffd7>function-flag</font> is the flag that r2 assign to our function (the ones we saw 
when listing the functions previously). Notice that <font color=#93ffd7>pdf stands for print disassembled 
function</font>.

That way, in order to print the disassembled code of main, we run:


┌                                     ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>[</font>0<font color=#93ffd7>x</font>08049050<font color=#93ffd7>]</font>> pdf @main           │
└                                     ┘



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/pdf-main-command.png" alt="pdf main command" width="950" height="560" align=center>




The same way, we can print the content of sym.mul and sym.sum:



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/pdf-fun-command.png" alt="pdf fun command" width="950" height="560" align=center>




<h3><font color=#93ffd7>Getting help.! The ? command.</font></h3>
If I want you to remember something about this post is this: <font color=#93ffd7>when in doubt, use the
-? command-</font>.


┌                       ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>[</font>0<font color=#93ffd7>x</font>08049050<font color=#93ffd7>]</font>> ?     │
└                       ┘


<font color=#93ffd7>It diplays help for r2 commands</font>. But it goes further, you will see that there are 
commands composed of more than one character, such as pdf, and talking about pdf, 
we saw that pd does print disassembly and pdf does it as well but of a function. 
Those two commands belong to the print disassembly commands.

Like pd and pdf, there are other commands that kind of belong to a <font color=#93ffd7>"category" of 
commands</font>, like debugging commands, register commands, print mode commands and so on. 
And all of them look similar within their categories.

Let's say you want more info about print disassembly commands, you can get such 
information by running:


┌                       ┐
│   <font color=#93ffd7>[</font>0<font color=#93ffd7>x</font>08049050<font color=#93ffd7>]</font>> pd?   │
└                       ┘



<img src="assets/radare2-basic-wf/pd-help-command.png" alt="pdf help command" width="950" height="560" align=center>




Following that logic, you can get help not only on a specific command, but about a 
"category" of commands.

There are a lot of other commands within the command mode. We are going to go 
through some of them but they happen to be more useful when they are used in visual 
mode so, we are going to see them <font color=#93ffd7>in the second part</font> of this posts.

Anyway, with the information at this point, you should be able to play around with 
commands, getting help about them and experiment to see what they do.

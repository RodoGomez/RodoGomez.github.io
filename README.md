# Welcome to my blog.!

You can find my blog on my [**GitHub Page site**](https://rodogomez.github.io/)

I've been always someone who is passionate about sharing what I know and what I just learned. I had this tought in my mind of creating something that helps me document my projects and that was useful for someone else who might find it interesting or want to work on something similar.

Here, you will find posts about projects that I'm working on, experiments I run during my learning journey, and information about concepts that I think are not well documented out there.

If you are interested in stuff like:

* Linux Kernel Development.
* Reverse Engineering.
* System security.
* System Programming.
* Computer Science in general.

You, hopefully, might find this blog useful and interesting!

I just want to request one thing from you, if you find the content of this blog useful and/or interesting, or think someone else might do it, please share this content.

**Let's make knowledge free and available for everyone.**
